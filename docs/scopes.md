Scopes are good for:
- Limiting what players see, even if they are near eachother.
    - For example, we could use the same map but have two simaltaneous games on that map to save memory.
- Containing the games characters/objects.
- Block world (a few options)
    - Keep Changes - Changes apply to the world and may be saved depending on server changes.
    - Store Changes - Changes are saved and applied to chunks when they are sent to players.
    - No Changes - All changes are discarded.
